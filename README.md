# Project Instructions

The goal of this repo is to make a functional app built on Express and Webpack to access the Aylien API to do text analysis of a valid URL.

The goal of this project is to give you practice with:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

## GETTING UP AND RUNNING

- cd to the repository master branch.

  - `npm install`
  - `npm run build-prod`
  - `npm run start`

  - The project server is setup to run in port:8081.

# Setup the Aylien API Key and SDK (sign up for the key from the aylien website)

# Setup the Environment variables to use the API Key

     - create a .env file and add your API id and API Key using template like:
     - APP_ID = Your API ID
     - APP_KEY = Your API KEY

# Use the Aylien API to get the endpoints.

# Use service workers to make sure your app works offline when server is not listening to port.
